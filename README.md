This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener. The listener sometimes fails to trigger, leading to silent authentication state failures.  The `authBug.js` file reproduces the issue, and `authSolution.js` provides a robust solution.  The problem is most likely due to network conditions or timing issues related to when the listener is attached. The solution implements a more resilient approach that uses promises for better error handling and state management.
