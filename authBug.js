The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not always trigger when the authentication state changes.  This can happen due to various reasons, including network issues, or if the listener is attached after the initial authentication state has already been determined.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as components not updating with the current user's status or failing silently.
